\
**In this project we will get some insights to answer this very crucial question.** This work doesn't pretend to be exhaustive, it just **provide an overview on the subject** which is really complex. Deeper study has still to be done to increase outcome quality, keep in mind that what we want is a **professionnal work with pratical and simple informations to help making investing decision**. Last but not least point : this work has to generalize well on unlisted companies to get an overview on all the economic system, that's why only corporate fundamentals will be studied.\
